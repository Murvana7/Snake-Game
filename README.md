HTML5 — game structure

CSS3 — layout & styling

JavaScript (ES6) — game logic & state

🧠 How It Works

- The snake moves based on keyboard input

- Food spawns at random grid positions

E- ating food increases score and snake length

Collision with walls or itself ends the game

High score is stored using local storage
